# Parking Occupancy Slot Detection System using AI and CV 
Research Graduation Project:

The project is aimimg to solve the problem of traffic jams and wasting fuel due to searching for along time for a vacant parking slot. The system is divided into two main stages:

* The first stage: detection of the patking lots using open-cv library to draw the polyline between the coordinates and this done by two methods the first one is to read and draw the coordinates for each row in the parking area and the second is to read and draw the coordinates for each slot separetly.
  
* The second stage: Classification between the occupied and vacant parking slots using YOLOv3 and YOLOv8 trained on the COCO dataset.
